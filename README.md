# Multi-Threaded-Hash-Tree
Implemented a multi-threaded file hashing algorithm written in C and executable on Linux. Wrote an experimental report comparing the execution time for different numbers of threads in order to determine the relationship between thread count, execution time, and the number of CPUs of the machine used.
